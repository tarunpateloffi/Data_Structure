        "Q1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "- Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in computers to enable efficient access and modification. They are essential for writing optimized code, solving complex problems effectively, and improving performance in software development, databases, and algorithms.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Mutable: Can be changed after creation.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q4. Describe how dictionaries store data?\n",
        "- Dictionaries in Python store data as key-value pairs. Each key maps to a specific value, and keys must be unique and immutable (like strings, numbers, or tuples).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Use a set instead of a list when:\n",
        "- You need unique items (no duplicates).\n",
        "- Fast lookup (x in set is faster than in list).\n",
        "- You need set operations (union, intersection).\n",
        "- Order doesn't matter.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples ensure data integrity by being immutable — once created, their data cannot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This means:\n",
        "- No accidental changes.\n",
        "- Safer to use for fixed data.\n",
        "- Can be used as keys in dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A hash table is a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to map the key to a unique index where the value is stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "Relation to Dictionaries:\n",
        "- Python's dictionaries are implemented using a hash table.\n",
        "- Keys are hashed to find the index where the associated value is stored.\n",
        "- This allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes. Lists can contain different data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Strings are immutable in Python to ensure efficiency and security:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Efficiency:\n",
        "- Strings are stored in memory as a single, contiguous block. Making them immutable allows for faster access and fewer memory allocations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Security:\n",
        "- Immutability ensures that string data cannot be changed accidentally or maliciously, which is important for data integrity in applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Hashing:\n",
        "- Since strings are hashable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets. Immutability ensures the string's hash value remains constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Key-value pairs: Ideal for associating data (e.g., name-age).\n",
        "- No duplicates: Keys are unique.\n",
        "- Efficient insertions/deletions: Faster than lists for specific operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scenario: Storing coordinates (latitude, longitude) of a location.\n",
        "- Since coordinates are fixed and should not change, using a tuple ensures data integrity. The immutability of a tuple prevents accidental modification of the coordinates, making it the better choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sets automatically remove duplicates. When you try to add a duplicate value, it simply ignores it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Lists:\n",
        "Checks if the value is present in the list.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Dictionaries:\n",
        "Checks if the key is present in the dictionary, not the value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python because tuples are immutable. Once a tuple is created, its data cannot be changed. This ensures data integrity and allows tuples to be used safely as keys in dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "\n",
        "A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values themselves are dictionaries. It allows storing more complex data structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "- For storing data about students, where each student has additional details (e.g., age, major) stored in a sub-dictionary. This makes it easy to organize and access specific data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "The time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary is O(1) on average. This is because dictionaries in Python are implemented using a hash table, which allows for constant-time lookups based on the key.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in rare cases (e.g., hash collisions), the time complexity could degrade to O(n), but this is uncommon due to Python's efficient handling of hash collisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "\n",
        "Lists are preferred over dictionaries in the following situations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Ordered Data: When the order of elements matters and you need to access elements by index.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Duplicate Values: When you need to store duplicate values.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Iterating through items: When you simply need to loop through a collection of items without associating keys with values.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simple collections: When you don’t need key-value pairs, just a collection of data items.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because the key-value pairs are not stored in a specific sequence. The order of elements in a dictionary depends on the internal hashing mechanism, not the order in which they were added.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it affects data retrieval:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Since dictionaries are unordered, iterating through them doesn’t guarantee the order in which the items will be retrieved.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Difference in Data Retrieval between List and Dictionary:**\n",
        "\n",
        "List:\n",
        "- Access by Index: Elements are retrieved by their index.\n",
        "- Time Complexity: O(1) for direct access (if you know the index), but searching for an element by value takes O(n).\n",
        "\n",
        "Dictionary:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Access by Key: Elements are retrieved by their key, not index.\n",
        "- Time Complexity: O(1) for accessing by key, as dictionaries are implemented using a hash table for fast lookups."
